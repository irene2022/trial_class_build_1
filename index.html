		<h2>My History with Pets</h2>

		<p>Pets are great! I've once had a pet pomeranian dog, but always ran away from her ever since she barked and scared the sh!t out of me when I was young. (Given below is a reference to how my pet looked)</p>

		<p>I've played with a bunch of stray cats.</p>

		<p> Even had a pair of Agapornis, commonly known as Lovebirds. One escaped (good for him) while the other one died of oldage.</p>

		<p>But the one pet I'd absolutly love to have is a bunny.</p>
